        <h1>Technical Skills</h1>
        <p>I've picked up a few programming and related skills through courses, projects, and internships,
          and I'm always looking for ways to learn more!

            <h4>Python</h4>
            <p>
              Over the past <strong>3 years</strong>, I've used Python for a variety of applications,
              including machine learning and web development, which gave me experience with
              <strong>Pandas</strong>, <strong>NumPy</strong>, and <strong>PyTorch</strong>.
              For my research on recommender systems, I wrote Python programs to scrape data from a website,
              run recommendation algorithms, and manipulate and visualize data.
              As a developer in Hack4Impact on the Love Living at Home (LLH) project,
              I used <strong>Python Flask</strong> to implement a web platform.

            <h4>React/JavaScript/HTML/CSS</h4>
            <p>
              As a developer on Hack4Impact and a SWE intern at T-Mobile, I gained two years of experience
              in front-end development using <strong>React</strong> as well as plain
              <strong>HTML/CSS/JavaScript</strong>.
              During my internship at T-Mobile, I built a real-time data visualization dashboard
              using <strong>React</strong> and <strong>JavaScript</strong> with a <strong>SQL</strong> database.

            <h4>Java</h4>
            <p>I have <strong>3 years</strong> of experience with <strong>Java</strong>. Since first learning
              <strong>Java</strong>
              in the Object-Oriented Programming course (CS 2110) at Cornell, I programmed
              an Android application with <strong>Java</strong> during my work at SmithMicro.
              I have also used <strong>Java</strong> to implement algorithms for the Introduction to
              Algorithms course, and as part of my responsibilites as a teaching assistant,
              I helped students debug their <strong>Java</strong> code for their Algorithm homeworks.

            <h4>Algorithm Design and Analysis</h4>
            <p>
              I've been an undergraduate teaching assistant for the <strong>Introduction to Algorithms</strong> course
              at Cornell for
              two semesters. Through teaching and answering student questions, I have gained a deeper understanding of
              <strong>algorithm techniques</strong>, such as greedy and dynamic programming, and applying them to solve
              novel problems.

                    In summer 2022 I did machine learning research at Cornell with Professor Sarah Dean.
                    I created a graph with three node layers that represent the multiple stakeholders in a Recommender
                    system: the providers that supply the items, the items which are recommended, and users who
                    receive
                    the item recommendations.
                    I defined item and provider visibility, which is a graph-based measure that represents the
                    number of users that sees an item or a provider through the recommendations that they receive
                    from the system.
                    By measuring and comparing the visibilities of items and providers that are recommended by various
                    recommendation algorithms, I found that common collaborative filtering methods show popularity
                    bias for providers similarly to items.

                    Love Living at Home (LLH) is a nonprofit organization that provide services to help seniors
                    live independently in their homes. They manage their many volunteers through an online system, which
                    was previously
                    hosted on Club Express, which struggles to handle their needs.
                    As a developer in Hack4Impact, I was a member of the development team that partnered with LLH to
                    create a new product that would enable staff at LLH to manage their volunteers' information and
                    service requests.
                    LLH staff can update and modify data securely and efficiently through this website.
                    I specifically implemented the transportation requests page as a form where LLH staff
                    can pick a date/time, location, contact information, along with other details about the request
                    and
                    submit it into the requests database.
                    As we used the Flask framework, I developed both the frontend and the backend of the transportation
                    requests form.

                    are organized intro three functional categories
                    (Account Management, System Configuration, and Additional Actions).

                    moves and strings, according to user input.
                    As the game takes in user input, it is important to handle errors and exceptions that may arise

                    As part of the course CS 3110: Functional Programming and Data Structure, I worked in a team of
                    four students to create a text-based game based on the Avatar: The Last Airbender series.
                    We designed the game to have single and multi player modes, as well as a continuous storyline
                    following
                    the original series. In the single player mode, the player encounters a new opponent at each new
                    "episode" that they must beat
                    using a set of moves in order to move on to the next episode.
                    In the multi player mode, up to 4 players participate in a 2 vs 2 battle against other players or
                    AI.
                    As we implemented the game, we focused on modularity to reuse as much code as possible across all of
                    the different modes of playing.
                    We wrote all of the story dialogues and the character details in a standard JSON format to make the
                    game
                    easily expandable with more stories and characters.
                    I specifically developed the build files, the testing interface, as well as the main gameplay of
                    both the single and multi player modes.

                  of an online archive of art and written works created by incarcerated people.
                  At the start of the project, I organized meetings with the technical lead,
                  the design lead, and our partner from Prisoner Express to identify the pain points of
                  the existing archive and desired features for the new website.
                  I then worked with the tech lead to determine the scope of the project and set a
                  detailed, weekly timeline for our semester-long development and agreed upon deadlines
                  and deliverables with our partner. During the semester, I helped onboard our five developers to
                  the React and Airtable API tech stack, facilitated communication between the developers and designers,
                  and planned and led weekly scrum meetings to ensure timely development.

                  I helped recruitment efforts at the start of each semester by updating section social media, reaching
                  out to prospective students at Cornell Days
                  performances, and greeting and welcoming new members at events during Orientation Week. During the
                  football season, I lead the 20-25 active members of
                  the clarinet section at all music and marching rehearsals, ensuring that all members have necessary
                  instrument equipment and information
                  to engage in the rehearsals.
                  Beyond these official duties, I fostered an actively inclusive and welcoming environment in the
                  clarinet section. I coordinated a forum to discuss diversity and inclusivity expectations for all
                  members and asserted
                  those values in all of my communication with the section. When members approached me with concerns or
                  conflicts with other members of the section,
                  I listened to them and worked with other members as needed to resolve the issue and maintain a safe
                  and comfortable environment for all members.
                  More regularly, I sent out weekly emails to notify members of upcoming events and to encourage
                  attendance at
                  rehearsals. In the spring, I organized and lead weekly
                  section events to continue section bonding and socialization despite the lack of rehearsals and
                  performances in the off-season.

        <h1>Values</h1>
        <p>While growing my knowledge and passion for technology, I also developed a greater understanding of my
          personal and professional values to use technology responsibly for social good. My two main values with
          regards to technology are education and diversity and inclusion.
        </p>
        <div class="values-text">
          <h3>Education</h3>
          <p>
            I truly believe that education is the most effective tool for addressing social inequalities and uplifting
            people
            from marginalized backgrounds. Education has certainly made a lasting impact on the experiences and
            opportunities
            that I have had access to and continue to enjoy in my life. My greatest career mission is to increase
            accessibility
            to education, and education technology is a powerful tool for connecting more students with higher quality,
            individualized learning experiences. Currently, I would love to work as a software engineer in an EdTech
            company.
            In the future, I want to learn more about human computer interaction and learning science to deepen my
            knowledge
            in education technology and do outreach work that connect more individuals with marginalized identities to
            education
            and career opportunities in technology.
          </p>
          <h3>Diversity and Inclusion</h3>
          <p>In Spring 2022, I took EDUC 3405: Multicultural Issues in Education at Cornell. As an assessment in the
            course,
            we were asked to write a Philosophy of Teaching statement, with respect to the history, policies, and
            pedagogy
            we discussed in class.
            In my philosophy of teaching, I draw upon my experiences growing up as a girl in STEM to assert the
            necessity
            of creating an inclusive
            space where all students are empowered to critically engage with their own learning and the world around
            them.
            I believe that it is my responsibility as a teacher to foster in my students pride in their individuality
            and
            a firm belief in the
            significance of their whole authentic selves even when life experiences try to convince them of otherwise.
            While I may not always be in the role of “teacher”, the importance and impact of cultural competency and
            humanizing engagement
            extends to all roles where diverse people work together. I have strong interests in building technology
            designed for the most
            vulnerable communities and to actively invite more individuals of marginalized backgrounds into tech
            education
            and jobs.
