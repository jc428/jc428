          <h4>Cornell '22, Software Engineer and Aspiring Teacher</h4>
          <p>
            I'm a senior studying Computer Science with a minor in math at Cornell University.
            On campus, I'm a teaching assistant for the Introduction to Algorithms course, and I'm one of the current
            clarinet section leaders of the Big Red Marching Band.
            I'm passionate about using technology for social good, particularly to increase accessibility to higher
            quality education.
            My interests include software design and development, algorithms, cryptography, and machine learning.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'll be graduating in December 2022, and I'm currently looking for full time software engineering positions
            anywhere in the U.S.

        <h1>Technical Skills</h1>
        <p>I've picked up a few programming and related skills through courses, projects, and internships,
          and I'm always looking for ways to learn more!

            <h4>Python</h4>
            <p>
              Over the past <strong>3 years</strong>, I've used Python for a variety of applications,
              including machine learning and web development, which gave me experience with
              <strong>Pandas</strong>, <strong>NumPy</strong>, and <strong>PyTorch</strong>.
              For my research on recommender systems, I wrote Python programs to scrape data from a website,
              run recommendation algorithms, and manipulate and visualize data.
              As a developer in Hack4Impact on the Love Living at Home (LLH) project,
              I used <strong>Python Flask</strong> to implement a web platform.

            <h4>React/JavaScript/HTML/CSS</h4>
            <p>
              As a developer on Hack4Impact and a SWE intern at T-Mobile, I gained two years of experience
              in front-end development using React as well as plain HTML/CSS/JavaScript.
              During my internship at T-Mobile, I built a real-time data visualization dashboard
              using React and JavaScript with a SQL database.

            <h4>Java</h4>
            <p>I have <strong>3 years</strong> of experience with Java. Since first learning Java
              in the Object-Oriented Programming course (CS 2110) at Cornell, I programmed
              an Android application with Java during my work at SmithMicro.
              I have also used Java to implement algorithms for the Introduction to
              Algorithms course, and as part of my responsibilites as a teaching assistant,
              I helped students debug their Java code for their Algorithm homeworks.

            <h4>Algorithm Design and Analysis</h4>
            <p>
              I've been an undergraduate teaching assistant for the Introduction to Algorithms course at Cornell for
              two semesters. Through teaching and answering student questions, I have gained a deeper understanding of
              algorithm techniques, such as greedy and dynamic programming, and applying them to solve novel problems.

                      In summer 2022 I did machine learning research at Cornell with Professor Sarah Dean.
                      I created a graph with three node layers that represent the multiple stakeholders in a Recommender
                      system: the providers that supply the items, the items which are recommended, and users who
                      receive
                      the item recommendations.
                      I defined item and provider visibility, which is a graph-based measure that represents the
                      number of users that sees an item or a provider through the recommendations that they receive
                      from the system.
                      By measuring and comparing the visibilities of items and providers that are recommended by various
                      recommendation algorithms, I found that common collaborative filtering methods show popularity
                      bias for providers similarly to items.

                      modify data securely through this website.
                      I specifically implemented the transportation requests page as a form where LLH staff
                      can pick a date/time, location, contact information, along with other details about the request
                      and
                      submit it into the requests database.

          <p>
            As project manager of the Prisoner Express project, I led the development
            of an online archive of art and written works created by incarcerated people.
            At the start of the project, I organized meetings with the technical lead,
            the design lead, and our partner from Prisoner Express to identify the pain points of
            the existing archive and desired features for the new website.
            I then worked with the tech lead to determine the scope of the project and set a
            detailed, weekly timeline for our semester-long development and agreed upon deadlines
            and deliverables with our partner. During the semester, I helped onboard our five developers to
            the React and Airtable API tech stack, facilitated communication between the developers and designers, and
            planned and led weekly scrum meetings to ensure timely development.
